# Halp: An Ad Hoc Literate Programming Tool

A quick and dirty Literate Programming tool hacked for my other project [DUMP](https://github.com/lmbarros/DUMP).

Someday I should rewrite it decently in Halp :-)

## TODO

* Keep prefix/suffix, as in [Mason Staugler's Knot](https://github.com/mqsoh/knot).
    * But consider adding an option to skip this behavior.
